# Getting Started

Currently, CoreScript doesn't support an REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop), yet.  
To get into the language, follow the [build instructions](../README.md) and take a look into the  
[example scripts](../Source/Script).  

If you're already familiar with dotnet core, compiling and building is straight-forward.  

When you are interested in programing language implementation, you might also want to check the [source files](../Source).  
CoreScript is written in F# and uses a recursive descend approach for parsing.

## Usage

Published self-contained:

```
corescript <file>
```

dotnet run:

```
dotnet run <file>
```



There are no flags currently.
